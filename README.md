Regression to find what temperature creates best quality of coffee beans

Findings:

Random forest regressor provides the best results with 90% R-squared and 3.7 MAE, hence this model can be used further for predictions.

T_Data_3_2, T_Data_3_1 and T_Data_4_2 are the important features used by the predictive model, which shows that the temperature of the chamber (especially the 3rd and 4th ones) plays a very important role in deciding the quality of coffee beans.

The quality rating provided by the model can be grouped using a business logic to determine the pricing strategy for the different quality coffee beans.

This model can be used to automate material quality inspection during the manufacturing process in order to reduce human intervention while achieving human-level or better accuracy.
